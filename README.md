# Sjg80-Mini-Project2
This is an example project for Python using GitHub CodeSpaces

DATASET
This data sets consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray
The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

MATPLOTLIB
This code is performing data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset using the Polars library for data manipulation and Pandas-like operations along with Matplotlib for creating visualizations.

POLARS
This code reads the Iris dataset using Polars, defines functions for calculating descriptive statistics and creating boxplots, and then applies these functions to the 'petal.length' column of the dataset while also printing the descriptive statistics. Additionally, it saves the boxplot as an image file.
